[![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/virtuosa)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/virtuosa)

A list component for React that combines vertical virtualized scrolling with CSS snap logic, allowing the 'active' element to snap to the center of the visible area.

This was created after realizing that other already existing virtualized list solutions out there fail to successfully combine these two.
